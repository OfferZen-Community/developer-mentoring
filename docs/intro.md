# The ultimate tech mentoring guides

## Welcome!

This guide has been developed by **OfferZen** in collaboration with **Project Thrive community members**.&#x20;

Since July 2019, **OfferZen** has been running the **Project Thrive mentoring programme** where we connect junior developers with senior developers for a semi-structured and supported 12-week mentoring journey. Over the last couple of years of running our programme, we've learnt a lot about what makes a mentoring pair successful, as well as about the common pitfalls that mentoring pairs experience.

We launched the Project thrive mentoring programme because we believe in the power of mentorship. Whether you're a mentor or a mentee, the mentoring relationship can have numerous benefits on your professional, and even your personal, growth.&#x20;

This guide will provide you with tips and frameworks to help you make the most of your mentoring relationship.
