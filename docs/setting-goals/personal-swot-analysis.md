# Personal SWOT Analysis

The personal SWOT analysis is a great tool to assess yourself and find opportunities for growth. SWOT stands for:

* **S**trengths&#x20;
* **W**eaknesses&#x20;
* **O**pportunities&#x20;
* **T**hreats

### Strengths

The first step is to list your strengths. Here are a few things to think about here:

* What qualifications/certifications do you have?&#x20;
* What do you do well?&#x20;
* What personal characteristics would you consider to be strengths?&#x20;
* What resources do you have at your disposal?

### Weaknesses

The next step is to identify your weaknesses. This is a good way to identify areas for improvement. Here are some things to think about:

* Are there skills that you currently lack?&#x20;
* What things do you have difficulty with? (e.g. procrastination, communicating effectively)

### Opportunities

Sometimes opportunities pass you by without you even noticing them. Here are some things to be on the lookout for?

* Are there any trends in your industry that you can take advantage of?&#x20;
* Can you improve your skills?&#x20;
* How can you get noticed? Is there a way you can demonstrate initiative?&#x20;
* Can someone help you achieve your goals?

### Threats

When doing a personal SWOT analysis it is helpful to think of yourself as a ship charting a course and consider things that could potentially sink the ship as you go about your journey.

* What obstacles do you face? (e.g. resource shortages, lack of room for growth in your current role)
* What could get in your way? (e.g. unrealistic expectations about what can be achieved, personal life)
