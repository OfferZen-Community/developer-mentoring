# GROW Goal Setting Model

We like to use the **GROW goals model** to set goals for the mentoring.

{% hint style="info" %}
ðŸ’¡**Pro tip:** [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3iJwoydBbg) is a video that explains the GROW model, which is a model that helps us uncover what you need guidance on. The video explains it from a coachâ€™s point of view. Pay attention to the definitions of each part of GROW.

A mentor can help you establish workable goals that make sense in your context using the GROW model. You can also start the work yourself to figure out what you need to do, and where you need external input and guidance.

### Goal

1. What is your goal?&#x20;
2. Why do you want to achieve this goal?&#x20;
3. What would be the benefits once youâ€™ve accomplished this goal?&#x20;
4. How will you know youâ€™ve achieved your goal?&#x20;
5. What would happen if you donâ€™t achieve your goal?

### Reality

1. What steps have you already taken to achieve your goal?&#x20;
2. What do you need to achieve your goal?&#x20;
3. What is the biggest obstacle you are currently facing?&#x20;
4. What is your inner critic saying to you?&#x20;
5. What fears are present?

### Options

1. What possible actions could you take towards your goal?&#x20;
2. What are the benefits and costs of each option?&#x20;
3. If money was not an obstacle, what would you do?&#x20;
4. What action step do you feel ready to act on?&#x20;
5. What strengths can you use to move forward?

### Way forward

1. What is the first step you need to do?&#x20;
2. Whatever your first step is, can you think of anything that might stop you from doing it?&#x20;
3. How do you want to be held accountable for this goal?&#x20;
4. What else do you need to consider before starting?&#x20;
5. How will you celebrate when youâ€™ve achieved your goal?
