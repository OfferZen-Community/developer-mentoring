# Why should you set goals?

Now that you know what it takes to be a great mentor or mentee, itâ€™s time to give some thought to the things that you would like to accomplish in your mentoring journey.

Effective goal setting is an important cornerstone for career growth. ðŸŽ¯



### Why is goal setting important?

Goal-setting is important in any career, but itâ€™s essential in the development space where there are so many diverging paths, projects, and areas of specialisation available to developers. **It will help you with two crucial elements:**

1. **Focus:** By setting goals thoughtfully and intentionally, you can make sure you donâ€™t waste precious time and energy pursuing the next big thing time after time. Instead, youâ€™ll be primed to focus on a set of skills that you know will lead you in the right direction.
2. **Critical path:** Goal-setting makes it easier to meet the milestones along your career development path. Youâ€™re able to break down larger tasks into clear and manageable steps that youâ€™re able to keep track of. Youâ€™re more accountable to yourself once a goal is in place, and that, paired with a crystal-clear path forward, helps to combat procrastination.

Before you set goals, it might be useful to do a [personal SWOT analysis](personal-swot-analysis.md).
