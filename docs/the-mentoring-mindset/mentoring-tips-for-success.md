## The Mentoring Skills Model

Mentors and mentees who develop and manage successful mentoring partnerships demonstrate a number of specific skills that allow for maximum learning and change to take place.

### Shared Core Skills

1. Active listening

Active listening is the most basic mentoring skill - all other skills require and build on it. When you listen well, you demonstrate to your mentor or mentee that they are heard and understood. The way you indicate you’re listening is by performing certain observable behaviours:

* Nod your head, lean slightly toward them, smile or frown where appropriate&#x20;
* Avoid interrupting&#x20;
* Remember and show interest in things they’ve mentioned before (“By the way, how did the meeting with your manager go?”)&#x20;
* Summarize key elements of what has been said

Resist the impulse to find immediate solutions to problems you may be hearing. If your mentor or mentee has a habit of going into immediate problem-solving mode, see if you can help them be better **problem explorers.**

2\. Building trust&#x20;

The more your mentor or mentee trusts you, the more committed they’ll be to the partnership, and the more effective the partnership will be. These things are key to building trust:

* Keep confidences shared by your mentor or mentee&#x20;
* Follow through on promises to them&#x20;
* Respect their boundaries&#x20;
* Admit errors and take responsibility for correcting them



3\. Encouraging

When was the last time you received too much praise? Never? You’re not alone! Effective mentors encourage their mentees, which in turn builds their confidence and enables them to develop. At the same time, successful mentees make a point of positively reinforcing, which helps to keep the mentor focused and motivated. There are many ways to encourage your mentoring partner:

* Compliment them on actions or accomplishments&#x20;
* Point out their positive traits&#x20;
* Express thanks and appreciation&#x20;
* Let them know how you use any advice they’ve given you



### Mentor-specific skills

1. Instructing and developing capabilities

All mentors do some informal teaching or instructing as part of their mentoring. This can take the form of:

* Being a “learner broker” by assisting your mentees in finding resources such as people, books, websites, software, etc.&#x20;
* Teaching new knowledge, skills, or attitudes by explaining, giving examples, and asking thought-provoking questions&#x20;
* Helping your mentees gain a broader perspective of their company&#x20;
* Helping them monitor performance or refocus goals as needed



2\. Challenging

Good mentors invest in the success of their mentees and, often, that means pushing them beyond their expectations. To challenge your mentees, you can:

* Set high standards for your mentee&#x20;
* Assign tasks that might allow your mentee to develop new skills&#x20;
* Question your mentees assumptions so as to stretch their thinking



3\. Providing feedback

Effective mentors provide feedback - both positive and corrective - frequently and sincerely. Read more about how to provide feedback here.



4\. Managing risks

Good mentors prevent their mentees from making unnecessary mistakes as they learn to take appropriate risks. In order to do this, mentors need to:

* Help their mentees recognize risks involved in actions and projects&#x20;
* Make suggestions to help them avoid major mistakes&#x20;
* Help them learn to prepare well, get advice, and then trust their own decisions and actions



5\. Opening doors

Mentors are usually in a position to provide visibility for their mentees. This means opening the right doors that allow them to meet people and to demonstrate their abilities. To open doors, mentors can:

* Personally introduce your mentees to appropriate contacts&#x20;
* Give your mentees opportunities that allow them to interact with important colleagues who could be helpful to their careers&#x20;
* Let them shadow or attend meetings with you&#x20;
* Point them toward a conference or programme that could enrich their careers

You’ll probably open doors for your mentees only when you believe they’re ready to go through them. Since your reputation may be affected by your doing this, you’ll first want to be certain that your mentees are capable and trustworthy. Explain this process to your mentees.



### Mentee-specific skills

1. Learning quickly

Mentors enjoy working with mentees who learn quickly and take the process seriously. Mentees should try to:

* Apply knowledge and skills learned, and be ready to tell your mentors how you applied them
* Observe carefully and learn indirectly from your mentor’s actions&#x20;
* Study materials your mentor shares with you, and then discuss them with your mentor



2\. Showing initiative

While some mentors prefer to lead the partnership, others will expect their mentees to drive the process themselves. Either way, they’ll expect mentees to show a certain amount of initiative. Showing initiative as a mentee involves:

* Asking questions to clarify and get more information&#x20;
* Searching for useful resources on your own&#x20;
* Stretching beyond your usual comfort zone to learn new skills or ways of thinking&#x20;
* Going beyond what your mentor suggests - take their ideas and show creative ways of using them



3\. Following through

Good mentees should:

* Keep agreements/deadlines made with your mentors&#x20;
* Try out their suggestions and report back results&#x20;
* Explain in advance if you want to change or break an agreement



4\. Managing the relationship

Even when your mentors try to take a strong lead, you’re the one who should manage the relationship. It’s your development, and you must take responsibility for its process and outcomes. To effectively manage the relationship, mentees can:

* Communicate with your mentors when you want to revisit your goals&#x20;
* Communicate with your mentors about your meeting schedules&#x20;
* Provide a focus for your meetings by creating an agenda and sharing it with your mentors (here is a handy meeting agenda template)
