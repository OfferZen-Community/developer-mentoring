# Different Types of Mentors
### (And How to Know Which One You Are)

![](<//img/assets/diff-mentors.png>)

## 1. The Advisor 💬

The Advisor draws on their experience and know-how to steer their mentee in the right direction. This type of mentor is best suited to mentees who hope to pursue a similar career path. **This is a popular mentoring style among Project Thrive mentors.**

## 2. The Protector 🛡

The Protector provides support and establishes a safe environment for their mentee. This type of mentor can be overprotective; however, they may be ideal for a mentee in the midst of a career change.

## 3. The Coach 🏈

The Coach is able to listen carefully and sympathizes with their mentee. These sorts of skills allow Coaches to easily recognise any difficulties their mentee might be experiencing, while also helping them to identify and strengthen their good traits.

## 4. The Connector 🔗

Connectors are always offering their mentees opportunities to grow. They're especially eager to draw on their large networks if it means that their mentee could learn or benefit in a significant way.

## 5. The Challenger 💪

These "tough love" mentors are commited to building up their mentees' problem-solving abilities. They push their mentees in order for them to reach—and even extend—their limits. The mentoring goal of Challengers is to promote their mentees' independence.

## 6. The Clarifier 🤓

Clarifiers use their knowledge to enhance their mentees' understanding of an industry. This type of mentor is best suited to a mentee that does not need too much direction, but rather a companion in the industry.

## 7. The Sponsor 😁

The Sponsor mentoring style is best suited for mentors that mentor someone within their company. Sponsors generally have a high position within the company and also have a vast network of people in the industry. Sponsors advocate for their mentees by recommending them for promotions, or using their network connections to help their mentee get ahead.

## 8. The Affirmer 👂

Affirmers are support systems for their mentees and are often regarded as good listeners. Mentees who are in need of someone to offer them support, specifically with tricky situations that they are experiencing, would be better suited to the affirmer. 

<!-- These last two mentor types (the Sponsor and the Affirmer) seem very similar to the Connector and the Coach respectively--consider combining or removing? -->
