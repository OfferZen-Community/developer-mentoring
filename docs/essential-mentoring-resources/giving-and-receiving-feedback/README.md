# Giving and Receiving Feedback

Using a continuous feedback loop to reflect on how the mentorship is going is very helpful to make sure that everyone is on the same page.

### Preparing to give feedback

So you have some feedback to deliver - great! There are four things you need to do to prepare:

BUT, preparing **what** to say can be the most difficult aspect of giving feedback. This is where the SIA model comes in.

### The SIA model

The SIA model has 3 parts:

When giving feedback, it can also be helpful to ask for the other person to give some feedback first - then offer some of your own observations or suggestions. You can start with these questions as inspiration:

* What seems to be working well?&#x20;
* What would you have done differently?&#x20;
* What are a few areas for improvement?&#x20;
* What have you learned?&#x20;
* How will you use your new learning?&#x20;
* What will you do differently in the future?

When you’re receiving feedback, this is a useful step-by-step approach to receiving the feedback:

* **Receive** the feedback:
  * What is the person giving you feedback saying?&#x20;
  * If there is something you don’t understand, ask for more information to give you clarity.
* **Reflect** on the feedback:
  * What about the feedback you’ve received is new?&#x20;
  * What about the feedback you’ve received have you heard before that conflicts or confirms?
* **Respond** to the feedback.
