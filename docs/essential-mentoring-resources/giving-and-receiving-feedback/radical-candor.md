# Radical Candor

The Radical Candor framework is a handy way of understanding how best to provide guidance and feedback. According to this framework, everyone lies along a spectrum of **caring** and **candor**. Understanding what Radical Candor is **not** can help you better understand what it **is**.

**Note** - These are behaviours that everyone falls into at one point another, they are not personality types.

### Obnoxious aggression

Obnoxious aggression, also called brutal honesty, is what happens when you **challenge** someone **directly**, but donâ€™t show you **care** about them personally. Itâ€™s praise that doesnâ€™t feel sincere or criticism and feedback that isnâ€™t delivered kindly.

### Ruinous empathy

Ruinous empathy is what happens when you want to spare someoneâ€™s short-term feelings, so you donâ€™t tell them something they need to know. You **care personally**, but fail to **challenge directly**. Itâ€™s praise that isnâ€™t specific enough to help the person understand what was good, or criticism that is sugar-coated and unclear. Or simply silence.

### Manipulative insincerity

Manipulative insincerity - backstabbing or passive-aggressive behaviour - is what happens when you **neither care personally,** **nor challenge directly**. Itâ€™s praise thatâ€™s insincere, flattery to a personâ€™s face and harsh criticism behind their back.

### Radical candor

Radical candor is what happens when you **care personally AND challenge directly**. Itâ€™s criticism or feedback that is **kind and clear**, and praise that is **specific and sincere**.
