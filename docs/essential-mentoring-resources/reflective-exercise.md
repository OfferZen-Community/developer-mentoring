# Reflective Exercise

If you're near the end of a mentoring relationship, it's good to take some time to **reflect on your experiences** with your mentoring partner. The questions listed below might be useful during this exercise:

1. What decisions did you make?

2. What went well and why?

3. What didn't go so well and why?

4. What was a surprise?

5. What challenges did you overcomse and what challenges still remain?

6. What have you learned about yourself?

7. What feedback did you receive (requested or unsolicited)?

8. What insights has this given you?

9. What perceptions have changed for you?

10. If you did this again, what would you do differently?
